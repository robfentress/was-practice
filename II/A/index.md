# A. Identify interoperability and compatibility issues.

Study topics related to strategies used by people with disabilities
Some highlights of the types of things to look for include:

1.  Keyboard accessibility

    a) Actionable elements (links, buttons, controls, etc.) are focusable with the keyboard

    b) All focusable elements must have a visible focus indicator

    c) Logical tab order

    d) No keyboard trap

2.  Test items using keyboard _and_ screen reader, verifying the following points:

    a) Elements must receive focus (links, data input or buttons)

    b) The location of focus is visualized

    c) The screen reader announces adequate tags or alternative texts

    d) The functions of the components, such as menu and submenu, accordion, tabpanel, carousel, etc., can be browsed or performed correctly.


3.  Touch device accessibility

    a) Sufficiently large touch target size

    b) Designing and building for any screen orientation

    d) Custom and complex (e.g. multi-finger) gestures must have an alternative method for activation (e.g., by activating a button)

    e) Motion-activated events (e.g., shaking the device) must have an alternative method for activation (e.g. clicking a button). The user must be able to disable the motion feature to prevent accidental activation due to tremors or spasms.
