# Practice Questions for the Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS) Exam

This is a repository for sharing practice questions in [GIFT Format](https://docs.moodle.org/37/en/GIFT_format) for the [Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/wascertification) Exam.  _This is not an official resource of the [International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP).](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org)_ 

## Note changes in formatting and numbering
Please note that the [WAS Body of Knowledge (BOK) document](https://iaap.membershipsoftware.org/files/IAAP%20WAS%20BOK%202_0_1019.docx) is not consistent in how or whether they number what they are calling _Study Tasks_.  Since I'm viewing these _Study Tasks_ as what are called learning objectives in standard instructional design parlance, and I want to be able to clearly associate these objectives with their respective assessments, I've corrected numbering errors and changed bulleted lists into numbered list items for the _Study Tasks_,  Therefore, when referencing a _Study Task_ in your question, refer to the structre and numbering system I have in this repository.  So, for instance, in [Section III:B](III/B/index.md) on Recommend strategies and/or techniques for fixing accessibility issues, there are four numbered _Study Tasks_.  If your question was for the first study task listed there, you would reference it as **III:B.1 Characterize and differentiate between the ideal/best solution and the “good enough” solution, respecting the particular project, its environment, intended target groups, and resources.** To see how I've numbered things specifically, just dig into the relevant section from this index page.
