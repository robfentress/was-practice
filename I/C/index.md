# C. Integrate accessibility into the quality assurance process.

## Study topics related to accessibility quality assurance
1.  Characterize and differentiate between the disciplines of Agile and Waterfall project management methodologies, and compare the approaches each methodology would have in relation to accessibility quality assurance. Agile management means testing in phases, while waterfall management means the software, for example, is tested only once.
2.  Demonstrate an understanding of the benefits of designing digital content with accessibility in mind as opposed to remediation.
3.  Characterize and differentiate between the disciplines of accessibility and user experience design and compare assumptions of each discipline. 
4.  Demonstrate an understanding of user testing, and compare to accessibility verification testing (AVT).
5.  Understand how accessibility needs to be integrated into the entire product life cycle, including concept, requirements, design, prototyping, development, quality assurance (QA), user acceptance testing (UAT), and regression testing.
6.  Identify ways in which each person's role in the product life cycle can include some aspect of accessibility.
