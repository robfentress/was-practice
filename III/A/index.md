# A. Prioritize accessibility issues based on the level of severity.

Study topics related to prioritizing accessibility issues based on the level of severity 

1.  **Identify the Issue:** Identify the accessibility issue either in the style, markup, or functionality of the content.
2.  **Identify the User Impact:** Associate the issue with the impact on the affected accessibility user. Differentiate between minor issues that can be worked around via advanced accessibility methods and complete blocker issues.
3.  **Identify the Legal Risk and Cost Benefit:** Determine whether the issue identified is a legal risk or a potential usability improvement. Consider factors such as visibility and frequency. Determine the cost benefit provided by the remediation, due to accessibility users' ability (or current inability) to complete the flow in question.
4.  **Determine Level of Effort associated with Issue Remediation:** Differentiate between style, markup, and functionality changes.
5.  **Prioritize:** Use the user impact, legal risk, cost benefit, and level of effort to determine severity, identify low-hanging fruit and prioritize all issues.
